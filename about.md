I work as a firmware engineer, but am interested in all parts of the software stack. From writing low-level embedded software, to doing web design, it all interests me.

I studied electrical engineering at Case Western Reserver University. My original plan was to become a hardware engineer. But, after taking several software classes as electives, I discovered software is were my passion is. 

I tend to work on many projects at once and chip away at them all over time. I hope to use this site as a place to store my knowledge and keep me accountable.
